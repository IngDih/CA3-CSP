Hi there!

This is my second ever built website, for the CA3 of Client-Side Programming (CCT2021).

On the first page there are 3 section: Staff Password Validator, User Generator and Food cost of the Di-Sushi restaurant (Japanese cuisine).
The second page displays some demos of Javascript and Library/Frameworks.

I do not own the rights of the images, and they were used exclusively for educational purposes.
